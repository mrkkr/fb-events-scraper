I included multiple common virtual environment patterns since they can be named differently. This will:
- Ignore `.venv` folder (your specific case)
- Ignore `venv` folder (another common name)
- Ignore `ENV` folder (another variant)

The trailing slash (`/`) indicates it's a directory.

You can create or modify the .gitignore file using this command in your terminal:

```bash
echo "# Virtual Environment
.venv/
venv/
ENV/" >> .gitignore
```

After adding these entries, Git will ignore the virtual environment folders and won't track them in your repository.
